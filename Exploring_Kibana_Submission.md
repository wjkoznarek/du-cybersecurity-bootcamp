  - List all the types of downloaded files that have been identified for the last 7 days, along with a short description of each file type (use Google if you aren't sure about a particular file type).
      - `css` - this is a programming language usually used for writing
          webpage elements and design
      - `deb` - compressed linux software package, used by debian-based distros 
          like ubuntu

3. Now that you have a feel for the data, Let's dive a bit deeper. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.
   - Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity).
       - **Avg Bytes:** ~9,000B
       - **Unique Visitors:** 2

   - In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity?
       - This seems strange because the amount of unique visitors was very
           low in comparison to other times. It would need more research, but
           this could indicate a user exfiltrating data.

4. Filter the data by this event.

6. Finish your investigation with a short overview of your insights. 

     - What do you think the user was doing?
         - Downloading a css layout, specifically a "pretty" one.

     - Was the file they downloaded malicious? If not, what is the file used for?
         - Likely it is not malicious, it is a stylesheet or layout for
             a webpage element. This is used for asthetics and theming.

     - Is there anything that seems suspicious about this activity?
         - Not particularly without seeing the actual file itself. This would
             be considered a normal action when visiting a webpage. 

     - Is any of the traffic you inspected potentially outside of compliance guidlines?
         - Unless there is a data download or bandwidth cap of some sort, this
             looks like it falls within normal user behavior.
