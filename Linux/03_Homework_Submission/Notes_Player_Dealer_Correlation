After analyzing the losses on the 3 dates listed, it is very clear that
Mylie Schmidt is the player cheating. She was playing every time the 
casino lost money. She won 13 times, while every other player who won
only won once.

After analyzing the dealer schedule and correlating that information 
with the player data and casino losses, it is very clear that Billy 
Jones is working with Mylie Schmidt to cheat. He was the only roulette
dealer working every time Mylie Schmidt won.
